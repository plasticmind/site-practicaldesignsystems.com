As promised, we’re going to get really practical. 

Starting tomorrow, I’m going to walk you through the process of building a “just enough” design system, from audit to design to code. 

I’ll use an existing well-known company with multiple digital products and show you what it might look like to launch a design system for that company.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll walk you step-by-step through:

- Performing an interface inventory of multiple digital products
- Extracting common patterns and components from the inventory
- Designing a few key components in Figma and publishing them to a global design library
- Testing the new Figma components in the context of multiple products
- Creating software components in React and publishing them as a npm package
- Importing shared components into another React application

Are you ready? See you tomorrow!
