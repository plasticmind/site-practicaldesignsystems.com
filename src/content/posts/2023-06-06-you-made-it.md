Look at you! 🏆 

You made it through 30 Days of Design Systems.

The goal of this series was to empower you by introducing you to the foundational concepts of design systems, to help you better articulate what “it depends” means. At this point, I hope you feel confident enough to advocate for the design systems work that makes sense at your org. Even better if you feel comfortable enough to tackle some of the work yourself.

What’s next?

Now that the 30 day series is wrapping up, you’ll start receiving my normal Design Systems Daily email — all the wit and wisdom of this series, without the pressure of a 30-day narrative arc. I’ll be sending out a huge list of design system resources in the next week or two, so be sure to stick around.
