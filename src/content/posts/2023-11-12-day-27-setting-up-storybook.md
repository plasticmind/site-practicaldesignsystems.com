Installing Storybook is relatively straightforward.

As I mentioned yesterday, I‚Äôm setting this up in my shared component library, so I simple went to my `bofa-components` folder and ran `npx storybook@latest init`.

I ran into trouble at first. It supports a surprising number of frameworks out-of-the-box, but because I had gone with such a simple initial setup for my component library, it wasn‚Äôt able to automatically detect what framework I was using.  I selected `webpack-react` though, and everything worked fine after that.

When I run `npm run storybook` the first time, this local Storybook view popped up in a browser:

I don‚Äôt see the **UtilityNav** component yet because I haven‚Äôt written a story for it. But the Storybook initialization created several sample components, stories, and doc pages. They‚Äôre helpful to review if this is your first time through, but I‚Äôll remove them and create a new story file.

Here‚Äôs the simplest version of the story:

![A simple Storybook story file](/assets/i/post-bofa-27-2.png)

The story is simple: I‚Äôm importing the component and exporting it with a ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù label. I‚Äôm not even passing the `activeItem` property.

The filename is `UtilityNav.stories.js` and it lives alongside the component file. Storybook is looking for any files that match `../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)` ‚Äî that‚Äôs how it finds story files. 

When I run Storybook again, this is what I see:

![Storybook, displaying the UtilityNav component](/assets/i/post-bofa-27-3.png)

My `UtilityNav` component is listed in the sidebar, with the `Default` story I defined, below it. And there‚Äôs my component, displayed as it would in any app, only in this isolated development environment. 

**Success!** üéâ

This is good, but I need to take care of something important. Engineers using this component really needs to know about the `activeItem` prop. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôll set the active state for their particular product.

I could list out each option as an individual story:

![Screenshot of a slightly less-elegant way of defining stories in code, with the resulting Storybook display](/assets/i/post-bofa-27-4.png)

But I want to take a more elegant approach. I‚Äôm going to use Storybook‚Äôs arg functionality to show those options as as dropdown on the controls panel:

![A screenshot of story code with args being defined](/assets/i/post-bofa-27-5.png)

By defining `argTypes` and passing in the options to a `select` control, Storybook now lets users select the items from a dropdown and see the component‚Äôs `activeItem` updated:

![A brief video of a user selecting activeItem state with a dropdown and the UtilityNav updating accordingly](/assets/i/post-bofa-27-6.gif)

This approach makes it easy for me to add/remove items. It will also be helpful if I ever decide to move away from hard-coding these items.

Now that I‚Äôve got a story set up for my component, I should create some documentation to explain how to import the library and how to use components in existing products.

More on that tomorrow!
