I just found this fantastic breakdown of different ways to visualize data in [a recent article by Sarah Zimmers about data dashboards](https://uxdesign.cc/are-data-dashboards-vanity-projects-e19929bb1c41). I’m always looking for clearest way to communicate insights from complicated data sets, and this chart just hit right.

**Data visualization types, sorted by ease of comprehension:**

- [Bar Chart](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/bar-chart-complete-guide/) - use to comparing values, readers need to understand shape and size
- [Pie Chart](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/pie-chart-complete-guide/) - use to demonstrate sizes of different parts of a whole, readers need to understand relationships and sizes
- [Line Graph](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/line-chart-complete-guide/) - use to show changes over time, readers need to understand linear progression, intervals, and relationships
- [Scatter Plot](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/what-is-a-scatter-plot/) - use to compare relationships between two variables, readers need to understand shape, size, relationships, intervals, linear progression, and distribution
- [Heat Map](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/heatmap-complete-guide/) - used to illustrate a data distribution in 2-dimensional space, readers need to understand frequency, data relations, levels of data, and geospatial differences
- [Tree Map](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/treemap.html) - used to show the hierarchical structure of data, readers need to understand process over time, levels of hierarchy, and relationships of concepts
- [Network Graph](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/network_diagram.html) - used to relationships between different entities, readers need to understand clustering, paths, edges, meanings of nodes, and zoom levels
