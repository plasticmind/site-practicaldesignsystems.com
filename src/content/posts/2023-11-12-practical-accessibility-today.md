Earlier this year, [I mentioned](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/practical-accessibility-course/) Sara Soueidanâ€™s exhaustive and wildly practical accessibility course. 

Good newsâ€¦ [itâ€™s finally open for enrollment!](https://practical-accessibility.today/) ðŸŽ‰

She isn't a sponsor, Iâ€™ve just gone through the course and found it beneficial enough that I think itâ€™s worth promoting. The course has hours of helpful video, but itâ€™s the practical walk-throughs of common interface patterns and how to make them more accessible â€” thatâ€™s what I got the most out of.

Sara is good people and one of the foremost experts in the field of web accessibility. If you want to make your digital products more inclusive to those with disabilities, thereâ€™s no better bang for your buck.
