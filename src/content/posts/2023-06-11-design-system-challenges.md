When I was preparing to write my 30 Days of Design Systems series, I thought a lot about the big challenges in this space. Here are my top three:

**Education**

There's a huge knowledge gap when it comes to design systems. Most people don't understand what design systems are, let alone how to set them up. When I launched the Practical Design Systems site earlier this year, I shared it with several technical communities I'm a part of to get feedback:

> I was extremely confused - I dont know what "design systems" are, but figured I'd get a clue looking at the page, but eventually realized [it is] more or less software process consulting, with no apparent connection to the name.

and:

> I don't know how popular design systems are. I've heard of it, but I don't know if it's a big trend?

Teaching people the basics matters. That's why I decided to kick things off with a clear articulation of the fundamentals. Sometimes people just need to see examples of design systems in action to understand why it matters.

**Organizational Change**

Employee churn and vacillating company priorities makes it difficult to do design systems work that endures. This is one of the reasons I suggest breaking the work down into chunks and establishing a community around the DS work so it becomes more of a unified group effort.

**No Single "Right Way"**

There's very little consensus around "standard practice" today. Each org has a different tool stack, which means that how these systems get connected can vary quite a lot, even between teams within a single company. This also makes it difficult to translate the "ideal design system experience" between organizations.

It reminds me of the growing pains that sprung up around responsive web design; eventually, designers and engineers found standard approaches to frequent problems and developed common patterns that began to be adopted widely. I suspect the same thing will happen in time with design systems, and as more organizations tackle this kind of work, standards will emerge.
