Every day, I’ve got a lot going on. I usually start my day by listening to meaningful books. I’m just about done with Making Sense by Sam Harris. It’s not very long, though, before I’m hit with a wall of tasks, notifications, emails, and meetings.

It’s tough, especially on busy days, even to find time to write this email.

But in those moments, I try to step back. To reflect. To breathe. To rest. Sometimes that’s the most productive thing I can do. At this stage of my life, 15 minutes of early morning work is worth 2 hours of late night work.

Those pauses, infrequent as they may be, bring moments of brief silences. It’s in that silence and rest that clarity often emerges.

So today, in whatever chaos your find yourself, take a moment. Pause. Breathe. Reflect. You just might find something you didn’t realize you needed to find.
