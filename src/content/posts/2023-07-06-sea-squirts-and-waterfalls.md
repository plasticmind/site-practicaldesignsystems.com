There’s a strange little underwater invertebrate called a sea squirt. If you saw attached to a rock, you might confuse it with coral, but they’re actually the closest evolutionary relatives we humans have among underwater invertebrates.

When they’re young, they look like a tadpole, swimming around looking for a suitable place to live. But once they find an ideal spot, something unusual happens: they start digesting their own brain. 

They just don’t need it anymore.

I’m still thinking a lot about [the idea that waterfall methodology amounts to a “pledge not to learn anything,”](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/over-the-design-systems-waterfall/) … and sea squirts seemed like a rather dramatic and humorous example of that.

…

I get it. There’s a certain appeal to a “set it and forget it” mindset of work, but if you’re going to do any kind of product work — and [design systems are products](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/your-design-system-is-a-product/) — you have to be always learning, always growing.

In other words, sea squirts make terrible product managers.
