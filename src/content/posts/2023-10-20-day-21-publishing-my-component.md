My Utility Nav is coded and styled! ðŸŽ‰

If youâ€™ve been following along, you know Iâ€™ve got more work to do to get the functionality of my component in line with [what I planned](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/day-18-planning-my-new-component/). Iâ€™ll do that soon, but first Iâ€™d like to get my component into its own repo and published to a discrete package so it can be included in multiple apps.

Iâ€™m doing a lot of technical work today, so hereâ€™s a quick summary:

1. Create a new folder;
2. Initialize the folder with Git (version control) and npm (package publishing);
3. Add and commit component code;
4. Update important package metadata;
5. Publish to npm.

â€¦

Letâ€™s jump into it.

I created a new folder called `bofa-components` â€” this will house the code for my new component. This is the code that will be imported into other digital products.

Initializing with npm generates this `package.json` file for me with metadata that Iâ€™ll need to update. This information shows up in the npm library and some of it (like title and version) will be displayed inside the `package.json` of the products that use your component library, so itâ€™s important not to overlook this.

Iâ€™ll also initialize the folder with GitHub so I can track changes to the code and easily roll them back if necessary. Iâ€™ve also connected it to a remote GitHub repo with `git remote add origin bofa-component` so I can pull it down to any other device. [More details in the GitHub documentation.](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)

The new repo is set up, so I can move over my component code from the other product (where I originally designed it).

Iâ€™ve done a little scaffolding: a `src` folder with a `components` folder inside of that. Inside the `src` folder, I created an `index.js` file. This is the file that will get evaluated when a product imports this package, so Iâ€™m passing along the Utility Nav component code as a named export.

Now, I just need to copy over the component files and put them where the export is pointing:

Using `index.js` in the `/components/UtilityNav` folder lets me reference only the folder in the export:`./components/UtilityNav` â€” I kept the CSS file named `UtilityNav.css` to make it easier to keep track of both when editing.

Finally, Iâ€™m going to update `package.json` with a description, a version `0.1.0` (it's now `0.1.1`... more on that tomorrow), and my name. After committing the updates to Git, **Iâ€™m ready to publish my package to npm**!

I already had an npm account, but had to log in from the command line with `npm login` â€” and then a simple `npm publish` published this package on npmjs.com:

You can see my published npm package here: **<https://www.npmjs.com/package/bofa-components>**

You can also see the published GitHub repo here: **<https://github.com/plasticmind/bofa-components>**

Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll import this component into my original application. It shouldnâ€™t look any different, but pulling it from the component library gets us one step closer to a connected system of centralized components.

P.S. If youâ€™ve just joined the list, Iâ€™m in the middle of a practical design system build. You can catch up at [the beginning of the series here](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/let-s-build-a-design-system/).
