(Sorry... this email should have gone out yesterday morning, but there was a technical glitch.)

I called an audible last week, and didn’t sent out any more daily emails after Monday. In addition to fighting off a cold (not fun on vacation), I needed some mental space to think about what’s next for this daily email list.

I named this site Practical Design Systems because I’m the type of person who learns better by doing more than by theorizing.

> “When art critics get together they talk about Form and Structure and Meaning. When artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine.”
— Pablo Picasso

But… my emails of late have been rather heavy on theory and light on practical. I’d like to remedy that by diving deep into some important practical parts of design systems. 

There are plenty of resources for learning to create components in Figma, publish an NPM package, set up a Storybook instance, or release a set of React or SolidJS code components; but I want to go through some of these detailed steps here so I can help you focus on the important bits and call out the parts I’ve seen teams struggle with.

Don’t worry. As promised, I’ll keep this bite-sized and digestible.

If you’re new and haven’t gone through my [Design System Fundamentals series](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/30-days/) yet, start there.

If you know of anyone who would benefit from a deep dive into the practice of building design systems… caring is sharing!
