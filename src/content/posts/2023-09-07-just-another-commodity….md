Taking a much needed break from the DS work today. 

Instead, here’s a fantastic quote from [Jennifer Pahlka’s book, *Recoding America*](https://www.recodingamerica.us/):

> “Treating software as just another commodity overlooks the fact that mission-critical software cannot simply be bought the way you buy a truck or even a building. It’s an integral part of the service you provide, and that service and the environment in which it operates are dynamic.”

If that quote doesn’t sum up the challenge facing modern design systems work, I don’t know what does.
