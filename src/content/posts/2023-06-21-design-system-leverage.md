I’ve talked with quite a lot of people who assume a design system is a template, something that can be copied/pasted between orgs. 

It’s not. 

It’s a codification of your company’s processes. Or, as Lauren LoPrete put it: “Design systems are culture change disguised as a UI kit.”

Here’s my point: the systems and processes you build to deliver on your value proposition are key assets for your organization. This includes user research, standard operating procedures, and yes… design systems. They increase your efficiency and capacity. They improve your ability to deliver value to customers. They give you a competitive advantage. They create leverage. 

That makes them financial assets of your company — and worth investing in.
