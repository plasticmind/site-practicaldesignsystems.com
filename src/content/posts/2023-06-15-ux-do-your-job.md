If you do UX (user experience) work, it is your job to consider the overall experience of your users.

Other people may raise concerns about setting expectations too high. Other teams might complain about how difficult it is to get it done. Other people may raise concerns about scope creep. These are often valid considerations and usually born out of past experience.

But you are a user advocateâ€¦ 

**Do do your job and advocate for users.**
