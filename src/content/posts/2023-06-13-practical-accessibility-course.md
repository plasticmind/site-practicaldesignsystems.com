Last year, my friend Sara Soueidan announced that she would be publishing a self-paced video course about accessibility. She's been a trusted voice in the accessibility community for years, so when she announced early access for people who pre-order, I jumped at the chance.

I was not disappointed. 

The course so far isn't just high-level concepts about accessibility and why it matters. It's also full of practical guidance like setting up a screen reader testing environment, browsing the accessibility tree in your browser's dev tools, and step-by-step instructions for making complex interfaces like forms and accordians accessible.

The full course should be coming out soon — in the next month or two.
