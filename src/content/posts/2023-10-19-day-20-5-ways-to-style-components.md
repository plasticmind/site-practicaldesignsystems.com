Yesterday, I built out the base HTML and some light styling for my Utility Nav component. I created a separate CSS file for my component, but itâ€™s worth taking a minute to talk about a few different approaches you can take when creating styles for a component:

**Inline Styles:** 

It may be easy to write, but itâ€™s inefficient, hard to maintain, and you canâ€™t use pseudo-classes. Iâ€™m writing this one off up front. 

**Traditional CSS:** 

Youâ€™re probably familiar with this approach. Itâ€™s what I did yesterday: create a stylesheet for my component that targets it by class name. The styles are imported when the component is loaded. 

Itâ€™s a common approach that is easy to grok. You can also mix this approach with a set of global styles, like grids, typography, and shared variables that get reused across many components. You can also incorporate a build step so you can use a preprocessor like SASS to make your style writing even more efficient.

If youâ€™re working on a complex app, your class names will probably need to be highly specific in order to prevent bleeding over from other styles. And highly-specific class names can get difficult to parse in complex apps.

**CSS Modules:** 

This is similar to traditional CSS, but a file naming convention (like `UtilityNav.module.css` lets the app engine know to load it as an object and will scope classes it to a particular component. 

For example, if my CSS file references `.UtilityNav`, when the app renders out the Utility Nav component, it may have the class `UtilityNav_ax7yz`.  This helps avoid the style bleedover I mentioned earlier.

**Third-Party Utility-Class Library:** 

Yes, Iâ€™m talking about [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) here.  Developers tend to like this because they donâ€™t have to worry about external CSS files. They can add whatever styling is needed by adding the appropriate utility class names. For example, adding the class `.mt-4` will add 1rem of padding to the top of your element.

But the learning curve on this can be steep, especially if youâ€™re not familiar with CSS. Theyâ€™ve got good tooling that helps make it easier, but you still have to set up the tooling. It can also make HTML difficult to read. Iâ€™ve also seen a similar problem to inline styling: when engineers are making design decisions for every element, a considerable amount of inconsistency can get introduced across user interfaces

**CSS-in-JS:**

Some people prefer to write JS and have the app engine compile that down to CSS. I am not one of those people. ðŸ« 

It does make it easier to manipulate CSS properties based on information the app engine knows about (like state), though I still tend to prefer managing these state changes with classes.

â€¦

So, where do I land?

Each case is different, but in this case â€” the BofA **Utility Nav** case â€” Iâ€™m starting small â€” a single component that can be included into multiple products.

I donâ€™t want the overhead of a large third-party library. I donâ€™t need the complexity of CSS-in-JS. 

I think a single component-specific CSS file is fine. As I add more components, Iâ€™ll probably end up taking the Atlassian route and creating a larger global CSS file for the design system that can be included along with the component.

P.S. If youâ€™ve just joined the list, Iâ€™m in the middle of a practical design system build. You can catch up at [the beginning of the series here](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/let-s-build-a-design-system/).
