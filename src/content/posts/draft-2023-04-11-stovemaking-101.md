What does is take to run a successful restaurant? 

Build awareness and excitement to get customers in the door. Make them feel welcomed and give them a memorable experience when they do show up. Figure out what to charge them in order to cover the food, staffing, and other costs. Oh, and the food needs to be great. You plan out your menu, hire capable staff, and stock a kitchen full of top-notch ingredients and tools.

One of those tools will almost definitely be a stove.

At the end of the day, you want to give customers a great experience and an unforgettable meal. A reliable, fully-featured stove can be an invaluable tool that helps restaurant staff efficiently make great meals for customers, but it’s only a part of delivering on the promise to customers. It is not a replacement for a competent chef. And it certainly isn’t going to get customers excited. 

A well-built design system is like a stove. 

It can be an invaluable tool that helps designers and engineers create memorable experiences for your customers, but it’s only one of the many important tools that contribute to the overall success of a product or organization. If you’re on the design system team, your product is the stove and your customer is the kitchen staff. 

- Talk to the chefs (designers and engineers) about what they need. Do those needs line up with what you’re actually building?
- Watch them use your product. Where are they having the most difficulty?
- Measure the outcomes. Is your design system actually improving the time it takes to ship great products, or is it just getting in the way?

Seeing your org’s design system in this context brings much-needed focus and clarity.
