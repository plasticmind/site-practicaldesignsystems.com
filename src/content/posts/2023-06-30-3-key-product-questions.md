I recently started reading [Building User Research Teams](https://www.stevebromley.com/book/) by Steve Bromley.

He opens the book with 3 important questions to consider when building a product:

> 1. Does this further our company’s goals?
> 2. Do we have the technical skills required to build this?
> 3. Will people want to use this and do they understand how to do so?

This is the first time I’ve heard those key considerations expressed so clearly. As you might imagine, the focus of the book is question 3 — arguably the most important, as it’s would be difficult to keep a company alive that produces products no one needs or understands.

Do people want to use the products your company is building? Do they understand how to use your products? How, specifically, do you know?
