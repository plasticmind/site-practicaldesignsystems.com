      <div class="c-section__body">
        <p>If you make software, you've probably experienced the friction between idea and execution. Stakeholder with big ideas that never make it to market. Designers with stunning comps that never quite look like the final product. Developers torn between building for velocity or sustainability.</p>
        <p>I created <b>Practical Design Systems</b> to help organizations solve these handoff problems. PDS is a consultancy with a mission to promote better process, tools, and communication between stakeholders, designers, and developers.</p>

            <p>I've been in the industry for 20 years, both as a solo entrepreneur and in leadership at large organizations. I started in design and pivoted to engineering, so I understand both disciplines well and can provide both <b>high-level strategy</b> for leaders as well as <b>hands-on tips</b> for practitioners.</p>
