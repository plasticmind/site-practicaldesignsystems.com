        <p>If you make software, you've probably experienced the friction between idea and execution. Stakeholder with big ideas that never make it to market. Designers with stunning comps that never quite look like the final product. Developers torn between building for velocity or sustainability.</p>
        <p>I created <b>Practical Design Systems</b> to help organizations solve these handoff problems. It's a small consultancy with a mission to promote better process, tools, and communication between stakeholders, designers, and developers.</p>
