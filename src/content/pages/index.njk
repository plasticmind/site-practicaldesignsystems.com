        <p>If you build software, you know the friction that exists between idea and execution. Stakeholders have big ideas that never seem to make it to market. Designers create stunning comps that seem to always overpromise. Developers wage an endless battle between speed and sustainability. Everyone ends up arguing over responsibility assignment, feature prioritization, tech debt, and padded estimates. </p>

            <p>I started Practical Design Systems to help organizations solve these problems by helping design and engineering teams work better together — with design systems! </p>
            <p>I began in design and moved to engineering, so I understand both disciplines well. I’ve also been doing this for nearly 20 years, both as a solo entrepreneur and in leadership at various enterprise orgs, so I can provide strategic insights as well as practical tips.</p>

He brought tools and templates from prior experience, but right-sized them for our particular context, then helped implement it so that it became part of our core process. We got exactly what we needed to be unblocked, in a way that felt easy to maintain over time.”</p>
